# Simple Query Retrieval System

This project implements a basic **query retrieval system** using an **inverted index** (Bag of Words model).

## How it works
1. The program reads all `.txt` files inside the `docs/` folder.
2. It builds an inverted index (word → list of documents).
3. You can type a query (e.g., "apple banana") and get a list of documents containing those words.
